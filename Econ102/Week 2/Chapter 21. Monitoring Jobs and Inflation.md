## Chapter 21. Monitoring Jobs and Inflation

---

### Chapter Objectives

- Explain why unemployment is a problem and define the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators.
- Explain why unemployment is present even at full employment, and how its rate fluctuates over a business cycle.
- Explain why inflation is a problem and how we measure it using the CPI. 



## Employment and Unemployment

#### Why Unemployment Is a Problem?

- Lost incomes and production

- Lost human capital

  ​

#### Labor Force Survey

- The population is divided into two groups:
  - **Working-age population**: total number of people aged 15 years and over.
  - Others: too young to work, or in institution care.

- Statistics Canada divides population into three groups:

  - _Employed_: A persons is considered employed if he or she has spent most of the previous week working at a paid job.

  - _Unemployed_: A person is unemployed if he or she is ...

    - ... on temporary layoff,
    - ... looking for a job,
    - ... waiting for the state date of a new job within 4 weeks.

  - _Not in the labor force_: everyone else.

  - ***Remark.*** The **labor force** is the total number of workers, including the employed and unemployed.

    ​

#### Four Labor Market Indicators

- _The unemployment rate._

  - The amount of unemployment is an indicate of the extent to which people who want jobs can't find them.

  - $\displaystyle \text{Unemployment rate} = \frac{\text{People Unemployed}}{\text{Total Labor Force}}$.

    ​

- _The involuntary part-time rate._

  - The percentage of the people in the labor force who work part time but want full-time jobs.

  - $\displaystyle \text{Involuntary part-time rate} = \frac{\text{Involuntary Part-time Workers}}{\text{Total Labor Force}}$.

    ​

- _The labor force participation rate._

  - The number of people in the labor force is an indicator of the willingness of people of working age to take jobs. 

  - $\displaystyle \text{Labor force partition rate} = \frac{\text{Total Labor Force}}{\text{Working-age Population}}$.

    ​

- _The employment-to-population ratio._

  - The number of people of working age who have jobs is an indicator of both the availability of jobs and the degree of match between people's skills and jobs. 
  - $\displaystyle \text{Employment-to-population Ratio} = \frac{\text{Employed}}{\text{Working-age Population}}$. 



#### Explanations for Female Increased Labor Force Participation Rate

- Increase in home productivity (home appliances, processed food, outside child care, etc.) created more time for outside work by freeing much of women's time from house work.

- Decline in average work week made it possible for women to hold part time positions.

- Trends towards smaller families caused reduction in childcare responsibilities.

- Major transformation of traditional roles previously attributed to women made more socially acceptable for women to work. 

- Large increase in demand for female jobs, ie. secretary, teacher, nursing care, etc.

  ​

#### Other Definitions of Unemployment

- The unemployment rate doesn't count the underutilized labor of people with part-time jobs who want full-time jobs. The official measure also omits another type of underutilized labor: people known as marginally attached workers. 
  - **Marginally attached worker**: a person who currently is neither working nor looking for work but has indicated that he or she wants a job and is available and has looked for work sometime in the recent past. 
  - A marginally attached worker who has stopped looking for a job because of repeated failure to find one is called a **discouraged worker**. The official measure of unemployment excludes marginally attached workers because they haven't made specific efforts to find a job within the past four weeks. In all other respects, they are unemployed.



## Unemployment and Full Employment 

#### Frictional Unemployment

- The unemployment that arises from the normal labor turnover -- from people entering and leaving the labor force and from the ongoing creation and destruction of jobs. 
- It is a permanent and healthy phenomenon in a dynamic, growing economy.



#### Structural Unemployment 

- The unemployment that arises when changes in technology or international competition change the skills needed to perform jobs or change the locations of jobs.
- Structural unemployment usually lasts longer than frictional unemployment because workers must retrain and possibly relocate to find a job. 



#### Cyclical Unemployment

- A worker who is laid off because the economy is in a recession and who gets rehired some months later when the expansion begins has experienced cyclical unemployment. 



#### "Natural" Unemployment

- Natural unemployment is the unemployment that arises from frictions and structural change when there is no cyclical unemployment -- when all the unemployment frictional and structural. Natural unemployment expressed as a percentage of the labor force is called the **natural unemployment rate**.
- **Full employment** is defined as a situation in which the unemployment rate equals the natural unemployment rate. 
- The natural unemployment rate changes over time and is influenced by many factors
  - The age distribution of the population
    - For example, an economy with an aging population has less frictional unemployment (less people try to find new jobs).
  - The scale of structural change
  - The real wage rate
    - An **efficiency wage** is a wage set above the going market wage to enable firms to attract the most productive workers, get them to work hard, and discourage them from quitting.
  - Unemployment benefits
    - Unemployment benefits increase the natural unemployment rate by lowering the opportunity cost of job search.



#### Real GDP and Unemployment Over the Cycle

- The quantity of real GDP at full employment is **potential GDP**.
- The gap between real GDP and potential GDP is called the **output gap**. 
  - As the output gap fluctuates over the business cycle, the unemployment rate fluctuates around the natural unemployment rate.
