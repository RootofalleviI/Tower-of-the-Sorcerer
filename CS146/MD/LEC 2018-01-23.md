```scheme
(define addr-book empty) ;; global var, visible throughout the program.
(define (add name number)
  (set! addr-book (cons (list name number) addr-book)))
```



### A short note on _mutation_

```scheme
(set! <id> <expr>)
```

- A $\texttt{set!}$ expression evaluates $\texttt{expr}$ and changes $\texttt{id}$ (which must be bound in the enclosing environment) to the result value. The result of the $\texttt{set!}$ expression itself is $\texttt{#<void>}$.

- Example

  ``` scheme
  (define greeted null)
  (define (greet name)
    (set! greeted (cons name greeted))
    (string-append "Hello, " name))
  ```

  ```scheme
  > (greet "Athos")
  "Hello, Athos"

  > (greet "Porthos")
  "Hello, Porthos"

  > (greet "Aramis")
  "Hello, Aramis"

  > greeted
  '("Aramis" "Porthos" "Athos")
  ```

  ​

### Global Variable

- Good for defining constants to be used repeatedly, but not good with mutation, since any part of your program could change the global variable. 
- The global variable affects the entire program.
- There exist hidden dependencies between parts of the program.
- Harder to reason about the programs.



### Application Memoization

- ***Caching:*** Saving the result of a computation to avoid repeating it.

- ***Memoization:*** Maintaining a table of cached values.

- Consider 

  ```scheme
  (define (fib n)
    (cond [(= n 0) 0]
          [(= n 1) 1]
          [else (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))]))
  ```

  - To avoid repetition, we can keep an association of pairs (n, fib(n)).

  ```scheme
  (define fib-table empty)
  (define (memo-fib n)
    (define result (assoc n fib-table)
      (cond
       [result => second]
       [else
        (define fib-n
          (cond
           [(<= n 1) n]
           [else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
                    (memo-fib (- n 2)))]))
        (set! fib-table (cons (list n fib-n) fib-table))
        fib-n]))
    
         

  ```

- ***Note.*** $\texttt{assoc}$.

  - A built-in function for association list lookup.
  - $\texttt{(assoc x lst)}$ returns the pair $\texttt{(list x y)}$ from $\texttt{lst}$ or $\texttt{#f}$.

- ***Note.*** $\texttt{cond [x}\Rightarrow \texttt{f]}$ 

  - If $x$ passes, i.e. is not false, produces $\texttt{(f x)}$. 
  - Same as $\texttt{(cond [(list? result) (second result)]...}$ 



### $\texttt{fib-table}$ global variable 

- How do we hide it?

  ``` scheme
  (define memo-fib
    (local [(define fib-table empty)
            (define (memo-fib n) ... )]
           (memo-fib))
  ```

  - The function $\texttt{memo-fib}$ can still affect my $\texttt{fib-table}$, but other parts of the program won't be able to see it.

- But this doesn't quite work for address book

  - Two functions need access to the global variable.

## Mutation in C

- Operator $\texttt{=}$ performs mutation (the _assignment operator_).

### $\texttt{=}$ is an _operator_

- $\texttt{x = y}$ is an expression, it has a value, which is the value assigned.

- For example, $\texttt{x = 4}$ sets $\texttt{x}$ to $\texttt{4}$ and has value $\texttt{4}$.

  ​

### Disadvantage

``` c
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  if (x = 4) { // sets x to 4; expression has value 4
    printf("x is 4 \n");
  }
  
  x = 0;
  if (x = 0) { // sets x to 0, expr has value 4, but C treat 0 as false
    printf("x is 0 \n");
  }     
```

- This program always prints $\texttt{x is 4}$, but never prints $\texttt{x is 0}$. 
- You can leave a variable uninitialized, but note that the value of an uninitialized variable is undefined. Typically, it's whatever value was in that memory from before. 

### Order of Argument Evaluation

- Unspecified, therefore don't do:

  ```C
  printf("%d \n %d \n %d \n", f(), f(), f());
  ```

- Therefore, never mutation and access the same value in the same expression!!



### Protect a variable from access by functions other than f? Yes, use $\texttt{static}$.

```C
int f() {
  static int c = 0; // only f can see it
  int d = c;
  c = c + 1;
  return d;
}
```



### Repetition

```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n){
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("Hi\n");
    sayHiNTimes(n - 1);
  }
}
```

- This is a tail recursion. It is just repetition.
